<p1 class="a1"><a>Checken </a>Chicken Handi or Murg Handi is that new found preparation that I cannot stop talking about. I have experimented with this preparation several times, catering to several distinct groups of friends and families on each of these occasions, and have managed to evoke rave reviews from them.

The USP of the dish for me is the earthen pot that is used in this preparation. The idea of cooking in an earthen pot has always seemed so fascinating and thrilling to me. I had experimented couple of times in past, cooking in a Handi (earthenware) trying different preparations but the outcome was a mixed one. On one occasion the Handi with the Biryani inside had developed a wide crack on its bottom and I was left with a pot full of half cooked Biryani which was difficult to reclaim. The disastrous experience had me avoid the idea of using Handi in my kitchen for some time and it compelled me into blacklisting the potter who had duped me into buying a substandard pot.

However, after a brief hiatus, I began thinking of using an earthen ware one more time, albeit with a different preparation. It was with this thought, I began to experiment with recipe of Chicken Handi.</p1>
             <p1 class="a2"><a>Paneer</a>Handi Paneer is a mouth-watering North Indian vegetarian Paneer Recipe. This delicious, creamy and spicy dish is cooked in a handi (pot) which is a type of utensil with a full bottom and shallow depth and is widely used in Indian cooking. If you donâ€™t have handi, you can make this dish in Pan or in a wok as well. This delicious dish goes well with plain or jeera rice or with tandoori roti or naan.</p1>

Aah, the smell of India a whiff of life in all its forms!</p1>
